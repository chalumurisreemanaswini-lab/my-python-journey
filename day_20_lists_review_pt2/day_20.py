# --- DAY 20: LISTS REVIEW + ONE NEW THING ---

# 1. Review
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(numbers[0])   # first item
print(len(numbers))   # length

# 2. One new list method: remove()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

numbers.remove(3)
print(numbers)

# It removes the value you tell it to.

# 3. Lists + strings together (tiny combo)
names = ["Alex", "Sam", "Jordan"]

for name in names:
  print(name.upper())

# SHORT MINI TASK
foods = ["pizza", "pasta", "rice"]

foods.append("soup")
print(foods)

# --- REFLECTION ---

# Today I decided to keep it light since I am very ill.
# I recalled things I had learned yesterday and one extra new thing.
# I learned how to remove from lists.
# I have learned one new thing and that is already a win for me!
