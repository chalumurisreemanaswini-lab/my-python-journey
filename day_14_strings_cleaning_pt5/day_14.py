# --- DAY 14: TTHE UNIFORM TRICK ---
# Also applying the knowledge the things I have learned back on the Day 11 file.

# Dirty data (Mixed up capitals)
user_1 = "ALEX"
user_2 = "alex"
user_3 = "ALEx"

# Clean the data by making them all lowercase
clean_1 = user_1.lower()
clean_2 = user_2.lower()
clean_3 = user_3.lower()

# Now they match!
print(clean_1 == clean_2 == clean_3)   # RESULT: True

# --- RELFECTION ---

# Today I decided to apply what I had learned before as more of a use that can be user in real life.
# I was starting to get overwhelmed, searching how a code I was planning to do works.
# I wanted to skip today for a break since I was starting to get upset with how little I felt like I was learning.
# But I realised just doing a simple code consistently is far better than multiple codes in one day and a long break.
# So what better idea than to apply knowledge from a few days ago!
