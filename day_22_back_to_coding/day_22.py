# --- DAY 22: COMEBACK PLAN ---

# NOTE: It has been 3 weeks since I have posted on Github.
# This was due my illness, busy schedule and a lot going on. 
# Also because I lacked a laptop during the time period.
# My parents very kindly bought me a laptop so now I am back in the game!

# 1. REVIEW (Lists + Strings Combo)
names = ["Alex"], "Jordan", "Sam"]

for name in names:
  print("name.upper())
  print("Length:", len(name))

# 2. REVIEW
sentence = "I am back to coding!"

print(sentence.upper())
print(sentence[::-1])
print("coding" in sentence.lower())

# --- REFLECTION ---

# I am glad to be back in coding again! I have some tasks to complete like installing Pycharm, Python and setting up the Github connection cleanly.
# So I will make sure to complete those. I also downloaded Notion desktop on this laptop and set it up.
# I love that app and it has proven to be useful every single time.
# That's about it for today!
