# --- DAY 12: CHECKING THE DATA ---

# 1. Is it all letters? (.isalpha())
# Useful for if you ask for a name and a user types in numbers.
name = "Alex"
print(name.isalpha())   # RESULT: True (It is all letters)

password = "Alex123" 
print(password.isalpha.=())   # RESULT: False (It has numbers)

# 2. Is it all numbers (.isdigit())
# Useful for when you ask for a phone number.
phone = "12345"
print(phone.isdigit())   # RESULT: True 

phone_text = "call me"
print(phone_text.isdigit())   # RESULT: False

# 3. Does it start with...? (.startswith())
email = "test@gmail.com"
print(email.startswith("test"))   # RESULT: True


# --- REFLECTION ---
# Day 12 and feeling proud of my streak. I had to miss yesterday since I had a lot of homeworks and assignments. 
# But that is ok, as long as I am back in the game right?
# So today I worked with simple True/False checks.
# I learned about methods like .isalpha() and .isdigit().
# These are crucial for data checks. I learned a lot and how to use it for actual purposes!
