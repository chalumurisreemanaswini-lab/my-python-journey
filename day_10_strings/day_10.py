# DAY 10: STRINGS
# (Now in the double digits!)

# 1. The "Shortcut" (f-strings)

name = "Alex"
day = 10
# Put an "f" before the start.
# Then you can just put variables in {curly brackets}!
message = f"Today is day {day} for {name}"

print(message)

# The "Enter Key" (/n)
# The /n will force the words onto a new line
list_of items = "Apples/nBananas/nCherries"

print(list_of_items)

# --- REFLECTION ---

# I am finding the advanced string stuff a bit confusing, so i'm slowing down. 
# I learned that f"..." is a shortcut to put variables in text without using plus signs.
# I also learned that /n is like pressing the Enter key inside a sentence.
# So I learned a lot today and I will continue this topic tomorrow
