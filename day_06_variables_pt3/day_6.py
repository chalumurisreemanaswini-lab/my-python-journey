# ---DAY 6: VARIABLES FINAL PROJECT---

# 1. Get user input:
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
birth_year = input("What year were you born?: ")

# 2. Use "Casting" to turn the year into a number for maths
age = 2026 - int(birth_year)

# 3. Create a story by 'Concatenating' (joining) Strings
# We turn 'age' back into a String so it can join the text!
biography = "Student " + user_name + " is " + str(age) + " years old."

print("---PORTFOLIO REPORT---")
print(biography)
print("FOUNDATION: strong")

# ---REFLECTION---
# It is now day 6! These days are going by like a flash.
# I unfortunately lost all my work for day 6 and I skipped day 7 for some other reasons.
# So that would mean I should be on day 7 atleast now but I had to redo all my work for day 6.
# But that is okay! Atleast I finished a lot more quicker due to the brain's memory cells
# and I got extra active recall to strengthen my foundation even more!
# So that isn't something to be frustrated about, it was instead a learning experience.
