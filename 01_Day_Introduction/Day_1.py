# ---DAY ONE REFLECTION---
# Today was honestly stressful trying to navigate through the controls of GitHUb to make day one.
# I struggled trying to set up my account but it worked out in the end after lots of tutorials.
# Currently I am active recalling the different data types

# MY ACTIVE RECALL LIST:
# 1. Integer (int) -> Whole numbers like 10 or -5
# 2. Float (float) -> Numbers with decimals like 9.8 or 3.14
# 3. String (str) -> Text wrapped in "quotes"
# 4. Complex -> Numbers with an imaginary part like 1 + 2j

# At the end, I got this set up, the most hardest part for me and im proud I have achieved so!
